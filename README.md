# Parking-Lot-Management-System
Hello World!!
This is my parking lot management system project done completely with java. 
It lets users get into a building, select their desired parking level and space then proceed to park.
They are issued with a ticket number which will be used when checking out to retrieve their information.
Their data is stored in the database when they check in.
When checking out, they enter their ticket number and their details are fetched from the database and cost of parking is also calculated and presented to the owner of the vehicle.
They then proceed to make the required payment and then they are allowed to exit the building.
That's it, pretty cool huh!!
